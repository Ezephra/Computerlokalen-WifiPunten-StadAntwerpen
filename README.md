# IT Project 19-20 (Groep H)

This is a responsive webapplication made by a group of students of the AP college.

## Description

This webapplication shows **the public computer rooms** and **places of free WiFi** in Antwerp on a map. You can view them seperately on the map or in a list. There is also the possibility to filter out the locations by typing either a district or location-name in the searchbar. 

You can log in and add your own locations to your favorites. You also have the possibility to request a route to a specific point, that can either be a location from the list or a random location you give in. And last but not least there is a form so you can contact us in case you have questions regarding our project or if you did find a bug, so we can take care of that.

## Usage
### Installation 
You need to install all the packages first:
```
npm install
```
Then, you need to contact us for the **environmental variables**.

Because it may contain some sensible information and it requires to sign our **Terms of Service (TOS) agreement**.

## Contributing
